				File Class and its basic methods

For File Handling there are 3 main steps:
	1) Open File
	2) Read/Write/Append File
	3) Close File
 
1) File Open Operation
	file1 = File.open("Sample.txt")				#opening file

2) File Read Operation
	data= file1.read					# File Read
	puts "Reading sample.txt in one hop "
	puts data

	puts "\nReading Sample2.txt line by line"
	file2 = File.open("Sample2.txt")
	File.foreach(file2) do |line|
		puts line
		puts "Seperater"
	end

3) File Write Operation
	f1= File.open("Writing.txt","w") 
	f1.write("This file is written by a Ruby Program")	#File Write


4) File append Operation
	file_handle= File.open("Writing.txt","a")
	file_handle.write("\nThis text is appended by Ruby program")

5) File Close Operation
	file_handle= File.open("Writing.txt","W")
	file_handle.close

6) Other basic file operations

	File.rename(old_nm,new_nm) - renames the given file
		File.rename("Writing","Writing#rename(old_nm,new_nm)
	
	File size-
		puts "Sample2.txt  Size: #{File.size("Sample2.txt")} bytes" 	#file size in bytes

	File.exist? - check existance of file and return true or false			
		puts "Login file exists" if File.exist?("login.rb")	#printing message if file exists
		puts "Sample file exists" if File.exist?("Sample.txt")				

	File.dirname(file_nm) - returns path of file upto its directory name
		puts "Location of Sample2.txt is #{File.dirname("/ruby_training/Sample2.txt")}"
	
	File.basename(file_nm) - return only name of the file from whole path
		puts "Basename of file /ruby_training/Sample2.txt is #{File.basename("/ruby_training/Sample2.txt")}"

	File.atime(file_nm) - returns recent append time for given file
		puts "WritingPad was recently appended on #{File.atime("Writing.txt")}"	#returns last append time

	File.delete(file_nm) - deletes given file from memory
		if File.delete("Garbage.txt")
			puts "Garbage.txt is deleted"
		end
